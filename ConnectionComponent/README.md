# Connection Components

## Backup & Restore

These functions provide methods to save connection component customisations to individual files for backup, and restore connection components from these files.

[`PoShPACLI`](https://github.com/pspete/PoShPACLI) (Version 1.0.0+) & `PACLI.EXE` are required.

- `Backup-ConnectionComponent`
  - Extracts connection component details from a PVConfiguration.xml file.
  - Any configured connection components can be backed up to file.

- `Restore-ConnectionComponent`
  - Restores a "ConnectionComponent" to a CyberArk PVConfiguration.xml file.
